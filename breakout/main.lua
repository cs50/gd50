    Pong Remake

    Author: Colton Ogden

    Originally developed by Atari in 1976. An effective evolution of
    Pong, Breakout ditched the two-player mechanic in favor of a single-
    player game where the player, still controlling a paddle, was tasked
    with eliminating a screen full of differently placed bricks of varying
    values by deflecting a ball back at them.

    This version is built to more closely resemble the NES than
    the original Pong machines or the Atari 2600 in terms of
    resolution, though in widescreen (16:9) so it looks nicer on 
    modern systems.

-- push is a library that will allow us to draw our game at a virtual
-- resolution, instead of however large our window is; used to provide
-- a more retro aesthetic

push = require 'push'

-- the "Class" library we're using will allow us to represent anything in
-- our game as code, rather than keeping track of many disparate variables and
-- methods

-- our Paddle class, which stores position and dimensions for each Paddle
-- and the logic for rendering them
require 'Paddle'

-- our Ball class, which isn't much different than a Paddle structure-wise
-- but which will mechanically function very differently
require 'Ball'

-- our Brick class, which the Ball must collide with to clear the map and
-- score points
require 'Brick'

-- a basic StateMachine class which will allow us to transition to and from
-- game states smoothly and avoid monolithic code in one file
require 'StateMachine'

-- each of the individual states our game can be in at once; each state has
-- its own update and render methods that can be called by our state machine
